# OBFINFO - Early obfuscation info file
# The obfinfo file is currently very new, so a lot is uncertain or undocumented.
# Take everything with a grain of salt

# CLASSES
a.a - Abstract class for all artifacts
a.b - Enum representation of the artifacts
ax - Star-related class, likely 
ck - Interface for everything that can be owned by a empire
f  - Alliance-related class
gw - Place where global configurations are held within

# Fields
# Enums
a.b.a - Representation to a.c
a.b.b - Representation to a.d
a.b.c - Representation to a.e
a.b.d - Representation to a.f
a.b.e - Representation to a.i
a.b.f - Representation to a.k
a.b.g - Representation to a.l
a.b.h - Representation to a.m
a.b.i - Representation to a.n
a.b.j - Representation to a.o
a.b.k - Representation to a.j
a.b.l - Representation to a.r
a.b.m - Representation to a.s
# Proper fields
a.b.n - The class the enum is representing

f.c - Used for the alive method, probably the starsystems the alliance owns

# Methods
a.b#a(nd, ax) - Creates an instance of the class the enum is representing
a.b#a(String) - Enum#ValueOf with an sysout in case it isn't found
a.b#a(void)   - Enum#values but the result is converted into a vector
a.b#b(void)   - Returns a random artifact enum

le#b(ax) - This only increases a counter used within le#n(void)
